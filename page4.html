 <p>One of my favorite hobbies is fishing. I am fascinated with marine life
   and a big part of my life has been devoted to protecting the marine life
   in and around my island. One afternoon after a slow day of fishing with friends
  I decided to dive a shallow reef to check out what was going on beneath our boat.
