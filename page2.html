<p> One day as I was walking through the bushes in search of some tamarind, about
  15 minutes into my journey I ran into a troop of monkeys. This troop contanied
  about 30 to 40 monkeys who were quite curious and wary of my presence.
  I quickly made my way to the tamarind tree and gathered what I needed then left
  the monkeys in peace.</p>
