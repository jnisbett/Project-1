Ever since I've known myself I have always been into nature and wildlife. In my
free time at home sometimes I journey to the rainforest to observe wildlife and
photograph them. I enjoy hiking as it keeps me fit and often affords me with precious
moments in life. On one particular afternoon I ran into a peacock on an afternoon 
stroll. Below is an image from my encounter.
